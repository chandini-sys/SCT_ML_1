# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project implements a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on:
- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms

It’s a simple machine learning project using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset is a small manually created sample. You can replace it with a real dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) or other sources.  
Each row includes:

- `square_feet`
- `bedrooms`
- `bathrooms`
- `price`

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- pandas 📊
- scikit-learn 🤖
- matplotlib 📈

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Load and inspect dataset
2. Prepare input features (X) and target (y)
3. Split the dataset into training and test sets
4. Train a `LinearRegression` model
5. Evaluate the model using:
   - Mean Squared Error
   - R² Score
6. Predict price for new input
